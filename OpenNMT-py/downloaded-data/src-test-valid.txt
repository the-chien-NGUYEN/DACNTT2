Trees epitomize stasis. 
What we saw very quickly is the world of both medical research, but also developing drugs and treatments, is dominated by, as you would expect, large organizations, but in a new field, sometimes large organizations really have trouble getting out of their own way, and sometimes they can't ask the right questions, and there is an enormous gap that's just gotten larger between academic research on the one hand and pharmaceutical companies and biotechs that are responsible for delivering all of our drugs and many of our treatments, and so we knew that to really accelerate cures and therapies, we were going to have to address this with two things: new technologies and also a new research model.

(Applause) So imagine the momentum we could achieve in advancing the health of women if we considered whether these sex differences were present at the very beginning of designing research. 
Now in the meantime, the audience, they go crazy.

And as I sort of looked into that, from a very personal point of view as a fisherman, I started to kind of figure out, well, what was the rest of the world thinking about it? 
And the three major phases of the early universe was energy, when the dominant force was energy; then the dominant force, as it cooled, became matter; and then, with the invention of life four billion years ago, the dominant force in our neighborhood became information.

And what's happening is that there's a globalization of illness occurring, that people are starting to eat like us, and live like us, and die like us. And in one generation, for example, Asia's gone from having one of the lowest rates of heart disease and obesity and diabetes to one of the highest.

Now, here at the National Aquarium we are committed to excellence in animal care, to research, and to conservation. 
To do so, she had to elude every big institution in her life: repressive governments, occupying armies and even armed border patrols. 
Nevertheless, there are still many, many women who, from early November until the end of the year, by comparison to their male colleagues, are effectively working for free. 
There were five climbers lost here. 
Most of the time it doesn't create any kind of mischief, but it does warrant looking at, so I'm happy we've got an opportunity to look at it today, make sure that it's not growing, it's not creating any problems. 
That confidence was based on two pillars. 
And then I said, carry on. Carry on. Carry on. 
Because in fact, this is child labor. My son and his wife sat in a closet for many years and developed this. 
The writer said "It's about history, plot." 
But it was not to be that simple. 
So I encourage you to ask yourselves: Where in your lives right now might defining your fears be more important than defining your goals? 
The first is defining the problem and understanding its constraints. 
Now here's a little video made by Matt Diffee, sort of how they imagine if we really exaggerated that. 
And if that little thing goes, all of humanity goes. 
He won the appeal. 
And we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want. 
We can do all kinds of conclusions and learnings from that data set. 
All other animals live in an objective reality. 
Physically, a really cool, elegant thinking coming along lately. 
So the Hepburn story is words and the Dietrich story is pictures, and so we did this.

You should try it yourself. 
And we argued with the World Bank. 
And I was in prison awaiting trial, and my cellmate said to me, 'You know what you have to do? 
(Music) Ray Morgan's voice will come in here. 
I found out afterwards, after I left, under a big fight, the World Bank. 
There is jeopardy, and of course, the closer you get, it gets harder. 
The one we know best is Darwinian natural selection. 
The other thing we can do is, actually, put in a chemical and deactivate it, so just place it into a box and ship it across the ocean, and that's what we did. 
Yes? OK. 
We need to continue to observe this star to learn more about what's happening. 
Some of them are orbiting now, including the MAVEN spacecraft which is currently orbiting Mars, which I'm involved with and which is led here, out of the University of Colorado. 
In the third act of "Swan Lake," the Black Swan pulls off a seemingly endless series of turns, bobbing up and down on one pointed foot and spinning around, and around, and around 32 times. 
Education under "No Child Left Behind" is based on not diversity but conformity. 
The world is filled with danger, things that are trying to frustrate our lives or reduce our success, reduce our opportunity for success. 
And that's exactly what we're doing right now, as we're in this tipping point. 
You find it associated with play, and all mammals play. 
I mean, did a designer come up with that? 
Democracy, in all its trappings, free elections, town halls, endless debates about the proper role of government. 
And I think where medical imaging is heading to is the ability to look into the human body and actually see each and every one of these cells separately. 
My grandmother taught me that things happen in the time they take, that time can't be fought, and because it will pass and it will move, we owe the present moment our full attention. 
So we clearly need some kind of idea of quality control and this is really where the idea of review and peer review comes in. 
This is Urbanspoon. You're in a city. It knows from GPS where you're standing. 
So, with all of these things put together, I think that the chances of life are much greater than I would've ever thought. 
It's as much a part of your stress response as the adrenaline that makes your heart pound. 
But when you shake it, you get Pakistan's perspective. 
The school teachers weren't having much fun, the sports were very dirty or very painful. 
It's because of the way the government commodifies food, and the cheap corn and cheap soy that are pushed into our food supply that makes these non-nutrient foods really, really cheap. 
But they were in Latin America or they were in Africa. 
Another red herring might be exemplified by the word "locavore," which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary. 
And it failed because of the great complexity of the underlying phenomenon. 
And so even though we're doing less per fish to bring it to the market, we're still killing a lot of these little fish. 
I'll explain that in just a moment. 
I believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility.

Maintainer:
And that's why we're last, because we don't value play. 
(Laughter) He didn't have to speak, but you know the bit where the three kings come in? 
His pediatrician happens to have a background in clinical genetics and he has no idea what's going on, but he says, "Let's get this kid's genome sequenced." 
It's a bit like going and cataloging a piece of the rainforest.

It's shaking me violently. 
This is what you see on Wikipedia pages. 
Now we thought, now what could be going on here? 
(Applause) Chris Anderson: Thank you. 
It can address the problem by getting young people interested in science. Look, science is hard, it has a reputation of being hard, and the facts are, it is hard, and that's the result of 400 years of science, right? 
Since it tells us that the largest number must be unique, 2,2,9 must be the code. 
Their argument was twofold: First, the artists we study are no longer living, never recorded their intentions, or are simply unavailable to answer questions about their work. 
You also see seashells -- as discovered by a team here in Oxford -- moving 125 miles inland from the Mediterranean in Algeria.

Now as you know, a great deal of time is spent, in this country and around the world, inside the climate debate, on the question of, "What if the IPC scientists are all wrong?" 
The "No" sign was pretty clear. 
So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus, I got some maps and some GPS coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings, the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees. 
I was like, "Where are you based?" 
So for other kinds of operations, there's definitely a need for other scaffold-based approaches. 
So this evolutionary foil safeguards the plant against these rather cute animals, and protects it and of course ensures its survival. 
And that's what we started. 
And it changed from a state that we would define as habitable, because the three requirements for life were present long ago. 
This model is an intelligent representation of reality. 
Because simple answers may emerge. 
So what’s wrong with the headline: "Eating breakfast can help you lose weight" The people in the study started eating breakfast and lost weight— but we don’t know that they lost weight because they started eating breakfast; perhaps having their weight tracked inspired them to change their eating habits in other ways. 
And if you drive a car in the United States, I would bet money that they have photographs like this of you going about your daily life. 
Because it turns out, some of the best and most humanistic medicine is being practiced by doctors whose patients aren't human. 
And the first thing you do is you calculate the vibrational spectrum of coumarin, and you smooth it out, so that you have a nice picture of what the sort of chord, so to speak, of coumarin is. 
The second is the efforts of our team. 
Here's my job and here's how much it pays, this is the kind of person my boss is, the kind of people my colleagues are, and here's how my customers are, here's how much I travel, here's how big my office is, how deep the carpeting is, how many windows I have -- a bunch of parameters. 
It's more like the invention of concrete: important, absolutely necessary to build the Pantheon, and enduring, but entirely insufficient by itself. 
Obviously this is not a mandated duty, but for the gifted filmmaker and the responsible journalist or even blogger, it strikes me as being utterly inescapable. 
Why? 
So what do we make of all of this? 
The average American used to be more than 20 times richer than the average Chinese. 
If you're really quick, if you're really quick -- and I can prove this -- this is half a towel from the dispenser in this building. 
So even though I have a fear of heights, I recently strapped myself to another human being and stepped out of an airplane at 12,000 ft. 
And in fact, in 2014, I was honored to speak for a half-a-day seminar at the International Seapower Symposium to 70 heads of navies about this issue. 
While a balanced bilingual has near equal abilities across the board in two languages, most bilinguals around the world know and use their languages in varying proportions.

So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions. 
"Why did we want to meet her?" 
I was wrapped in ice, and then eventually put into a drug-induced coma. 
So once those cells are on the patient they will stick where they need to be. 
He needs a guaranteed success, and so what he does is, he holds a competition. 
And we’re only just beginning to grasp it. 
A semicolon's job is to reunite two independent clauses that will benefit from one another's company because they refer to the same thing. 
When a dragonfly flutters by, you may not realize, but it's the greatest flier in nature. 
No, because at that time, education was banned for girls, completely. 
And best of all, your motivation is: simplicity sells. 
And the way to ask that question is to look at the Neanderthal that comes from Southern Europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today. 
Here's a theory: Could it be that those ties to ancestral soil, the soft variables reflected in their aphorisms, actually affect longevity? 
Because the people who fancy you are just going to fancy you anyway, and the unimportant losers who don't, well, they only play up to your advantage. 
We had stories like "The Seven-League Boots": the giant who had these boots, where, once you put them on, with every stride you could cover seven leagues, or 21 miles, a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal. 
Does that sound kind of familiar? 
Now, after years of work, I'll soon be submitting my geophysical and geochemical studies for publication. 
The travel time could take a year or even longer.

It's a secret. 
We can put those onto a material, and we can make that material very complex if we want to, and we can then grow that up in the lab or we can put it straight back into the patient. 
We need to stop buying the lie that these images tell us. 
And one of the things we've learned, unfortunately, is that upward mobility isn't as high as we'd like it to be in this country, and interestingly, it's very geographically distributed.

The European population and North African -- the Eastern bluefin tuna -- is fished at tremendous levels: 50,000 tons over the last decade almost every year. 
So, some of the stories are just so classic, and yet so understandable.

So unrealistic optimism can lead to risky behavior, to financial collapse, to faulty planning. 
So what are these dots? 
That's when I was discharged from the system. 
First off, my badge says I'm an astronomer. 
And you go from being a healthy, robust 29-year-old male to someone that cannot breathe, cannot move, cannot speak. 
Now take a look at New York. 
Studies tell us that even a two-minute distraction is sufficient to break the urge to ruminate in that moment. 
But this doesn’t mean that it’s a sufficient condition – planets like Venus have atmospheres but lack other criteria for habitability. 
It seems to me, therefore, patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads, or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes.
